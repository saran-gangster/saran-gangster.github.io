            <p>Web app built with Flask that given a stock ticker will scrape dozens of articles off of Nasdaq.com and
            run them through a machine learning model for analysis.</p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Thousands of methods have been developed to predict stock performance, some taking dozens of parameters
                and using complicated calculations. However, I realized that the market is ultimately determined by
                supply and demand, which means the stock is worth as much as the investors value them. I wanted to try a
                more qualitative approach, using sentimental analysis on stock market news to determine stock
                performance.</p>
            <h2>What It Does</h2>
            <p>Given a stock ticker (i.e. AAPL) it searches NASDAQ.com for related articles and scrapes off all the
                data. It then cleans the data removing unrelated items (like headers and footers). It then breaks the
                text into 5000 character chunks and using Azure Text Api it analyzes all the chunks of data. It averages
                the results and outputs a percentage. I.e. the higher the rating the higher the overall sentiment of
                news articles, 100% = overwhelmingly positive, 0% = overwhelmingly negative, and 50% = neutral.</p>
            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p>The back-end is created in Flask, and data scraping is done with beautifulsoup4. Azure Text Api is used
                to provide analysis.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p><b>Scraping Data: </b>My original plan was to find all of the links on Stock page on NASDAQ.com and then
                download the data from
                there, but the problem was that every page would have over 100 links and only 10 of them were the
                articles I wanted. I had to filter all of the links by discovering a hidden attribute in all of the
                articles.</p>
            <p><b>Slow Loading Speeds: </b>The problem was when there were a lot of articles to download, the file sizes
                could get quite large even
                if the articles themselves were small (100 articles @ 2mb each = 200mb download). The solution was to
                parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup4 before the images were loaded. This improved response time by a
                factor of 10. So now instead of running the algorithm on 10 articles in 10 seconds, 100 articles could
                be analyzed in the same time.</p>
            <h2>Future Ideas And Whats Next</h2>
            <p>In the future I would like to make a new machine learning model to further improve the prediction
                accuracy. I would implement a Recursive Neural Network based off of Andrej Karpathy's research paper. I
                would train this model on solely finance related articles and by doing this I believe error could be
                reduced substantially and the accuracy would be unparalleled.</p>
