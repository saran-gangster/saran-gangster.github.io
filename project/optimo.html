            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Web app to help users benchmark their eyesight (i.e. 20/20 or 20/100) by taking on online test, no doctor
                required!</p>

            <h2>Installation & Usage</h2>
            <a href="https://twinkleyoureyes.000webhostapp.com/" target="_blank"><p>Try it out here on chrome!</p></a>
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>To reduce the cost of testing the eyesight.</p>
            <h2>What It Does</h2>
            <p>Users stand 10ft away from their computer and simply read out the letters on screen until the application
                has enough information to calculate their eyesight. I base calculations off of the research on the
                Snellen
                standard.</p>
            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p>This web app runs completely in browser (a goal because I wanted anyone be able to use it) so all code is
                in
                native HTML/CSS/JS, the only library used was the WebKit Api for voice recognition and processing user
                input.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p><b>Voice recognition: </b>There are a lot of voice recognition technologies out there, but out of the
                dozen I tried, most of them
                were too slow to be practical for real world use. Even the fastest implementation I tested still
                requires
                the user to wait a few seconds between reading out letters. And worse yet, it sacrifices accuracy for
                speed, so in loud environments it can throw off the application's calculations.</p>
            <p><b>Dynamic display sizes: </b>Every display is different and I needed a way to standardize the size of
                all of the text on screen so I
                could ensure the test remained accurate. The complicating part was that the size of the next few words
                shown on screen is calculated based off of your results from the previous words so it makes things a bit
                more challenging.</p>
            <h2>Future Ideas And Whats Next</h2>
            <p>In the future I would like to make a better implementation of the voice recognition as sometimes it
                struggles
                with accuracy. At the hackathon where this project was demo'ed I had a physician approach me after and
                we
                started talking about the idea of licensing this software to medical professionals. Obviously this
                program
                would need extensive testing and clinical trials to prove its accuracy but it would definitely be cool
                if
                this was a commercial product some day!</p>
