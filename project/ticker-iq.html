            <h2>Installation & Usage</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/saran-gangster/Ticker-iq"><p>Github Repo</p></a>
            <p><span class="code"># You will need to have Java version 8 install (SDK 1.8)</span></p>
            <p><span class="code">$ git clone https://github.com/saran-gangster/Ticker-iq.git</span></p>
            <p><span class="code"># Import the project into your IDE of choice and setup the SDK as 1.8. Depending on
                your installation you may need to install JavaFX separately. (Note: it may work with other versions of
                Java, but is untested)</span>
            </p>
            <p><span class="code"># Run the program from the main.java class and from there you should be up and
                running! Be sure to also be connected to the internet so you can download new stock data.</span>
            </p>


            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>I saw websites like tradingview.com and other similar projects, and I wanted a stock screener that I could
                run on my desktop while I traded. That was how Ticker-iQ was born. A desktop application that could process
                all of the basic information needed for swing trading as well as help me manage my portfolio.</p>
            <h2>What It Does</h2>
            <p>Ticker-iQ presents various stock data in a visually pleasing way, it allows users to see daily trading
                numbers, price history, browse current news with the in-built browser, and setup their portfolio
                automatically calculating things like profit/loss per share and in total.</p>
            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p>This program is created solely in JavaFX and all data is downloaded in realtime from nasdaq.com and then
                graphed visually with JavaFX. The portfolio manager saves information locally to a text file when a user inputs
                various data for computation.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The main challenge I ran into was where to get the data. Many sources would either require too many steps
                to get the data making automation next to impossible. Many sources are also are paid, making them not viable for my
                student budget. And lastly, many websites had scripts in place to protect against automated requests.</p>
            <h2>Future Ideas And Whats Next</h2>
            <p>In the future I would like port this project to Android for mobile use. As well in the future I will start using the data I'm
                collecting to add technical indicators to graphs as an option.</p>
